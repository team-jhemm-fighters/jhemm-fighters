                                Games were my gateway into computer science and programming, so it just seemed right to join this team for my first major programming project. The world is burning, and sometimes a guy just needs to have some fun, y’know?

                                I am an outdoorsman through and through. The only time I stay inside is if it is almost flooding. I hate doing nothing, so I am always searching for a new hobby I can throw myself into.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My hobbies are mainly getting outside and doing things, staying inside and doing things if it’s raining, and googling new activities.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Why I Chose This Project</h3>
                            <p>
                                I’ve been gaming my entire life. It all started with watching my dad play the original DOOM on the PS1, and when I was able to use a controller myself I couldn’t put it down. After video gaming for a few years, I got introduced to the world of DND and tabletop gaming, and have been doing both ever since. When I saw the project pitched, I saw the chance to add elements from both my passions and use it as an enjoyable way to improve as a developer.

                            <p>
                                From adventuring alone in various video games, to playing board games with friends, to participating in my national LARPing organization (Tunnel Snakes rule), gaming has always had a special place in my life. Other than that, I am an avid reader of fantasy, sci-fi, and mystery novels.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Why I Chose This Project</h3>
                            <p>
                                I came up with the base idea for this project when I saw another cohort make a single player game. I wanted to make a game as well and came up with an idea to switch players with a privacy screen. I find games bring people together and allow one to lose themselves in the moment, whether it’s fighting a monster, saving a member of royalty, or flying through the galaxy. Video games allow you to live another life.

                                First and foremost, I enjoy video games. Adventure, RPG, Action, whatever, if it is a good game I’ll play it. I also enjoy boarding: surfing, wakeboarding, snowboarding. Chances are that if you can do it on a board, I’ll like it.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Why I Chose This Project</h3>
                            <p>
                                Ever since I first picked up a controller, I had always thought about how cool it would be to make a game of my own. Strategy that I have learned from playing games has changed how I think about programming and the world. I was also told games were going to be difficult to code, so this was also an enjoyable way to improve my skills.

                                Video games have always been special to me. Growing up, it was my favorite activity to do with friends or family. More recently, I’ve been getting into lifting and sports (playing them recreationally and watching them at a professional level).
                            </p>
                            <h3>Why I Chose This Project</h3>
                            <p>
                                I wanted to work on this project because I knew it was something that I would be passionate about. Video games are my number one hobby, and because I’ve been playing them for so long, I knew that I could translate feature ideas from other games into JavaScript code. On top of that, gaming projects were described as difficult, so I wanted to put myself in a situation where I could struggle and grow.
